# CccRCC

This repository contains R scripts used to perform secondary analysis on ccRCC from both Chinese Kidney Cancer (CKC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets
studied in the manuscript titled "Transcriptomic characterization and innovative molecular classification of clear cell renal cell carcinoma in the Chinese population".
Three separate R scripts are provided: "expression.R" is for gene expression level analysis; "mutation.R" is for mutational analysis; "fusion.R" is for gene fusion analysis.
